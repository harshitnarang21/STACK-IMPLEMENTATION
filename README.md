This basic Python program demonstrates stack implementation using a list. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The program includes three main operations: **push**, to add an element to the top of the stack; **pop**, to remove the topmost element; and **display**, to show all current elements in the stack from top to bottom. It uses simple function definitions and a menu-driven approach to allow users to choose operations repeatedly. Error handling is included to prevent popping from an empty stack. This program helps beginners understand how stacks work conceptually and how to implement them practically in Python.
